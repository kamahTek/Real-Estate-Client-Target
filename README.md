# Real-Estate-Client-Target

## Overview

The goal of this project is to help a real estate agency more effectively target potential clients by predicting which individuals earn more than $50K per year. Accurate income prediction will allow the agency to tailor its marketing strategies towards high-income clients, who are more likely to engage in high-value real estate transactions.

To achieve this, the project will use the [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult), which includes various demographic and employment related attributes such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week. These features will be used to train a machine learning model that can classify individuals as either earning above or below $50K annually.
